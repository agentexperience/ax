title: "Agent Experience Is the Only Experience That Matters"
description: "Ivan Burazin argues that as AI agents increasingly write and execute code independently, tools must shift from optimizing Developer Experience (DX) to Agent Experience (AX) - designing for autonomous agent operation rather than human interaction. He presents Daytona's agent-native infrastructure that provides serverless, stateful runtimes allowing agents to spin up environments in 90ms and operate completely autonomously without human intervention."
